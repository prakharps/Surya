Machine Learning,

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence that provides program the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
In machine learning a computer is said to be learning from Experiences with respect to some class of Tasks, if its performance in a given Task improves with the Experience.
Machine learning is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that which makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn
. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.

Sometimes people get confused between Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence, they both are terms of computer science.
In case of machine learning, the aim is to increase accuracy, but it does not care about success, but in case of Artificial Intelligence, 
the aim is to increase chance of success and not accuracy. In case of machine learning, the goal is to learn from data on certain task to maximize the performance of machine on this task
but in case of artificial intelligence the goal is to simulate natural intelligence to solve complex problem.

There are 4 types of learning in Machine learning:
1)Supervised Learning.
2)Unsupervised Learning.
3)Semi-supervised Learning.
4)Reinforcement Learning.

Supervised Learning 
Supervised learning is when the model is getting trained on a labelled dataset. Labelled dataset is one which have both input and output parameters. In this type of learning both training and validation datasets are labelled
While training the model, data is usually split in the ratio of 80:20 i.e. 80% as training data and rest as testing data. In training data, we feed input as well as output for 80% data. The model learns from training data only. We use different machine learning algorithms to build our model. By learning, it means that the model will build some logic of its own.

Unsupervised Learning
It’s a type of learning where we don’t give target to our model while training i.e. training model has only input parameter values. The model by itself has to find which way it can learn.

Semi-supervised Learning
In the previous two types, either there are no labels for all the observation in the dataset or labels are present for all the observations. Semi-supervised learning falls in between these two. In many practical situations, the cost to label is quite high, since it requires skilled human experts to do that. So, in the absence of labels in the majority of the observations but present in few, semi-supervised algorithms are the best candidates for the model building. These methods exploit the idea that even though the group memberships of the unlabeled data are unknown, this data carries important information about the group parameters.

Reinforcement Learning
In this technique, model keeps on increasing its performance using a Reward Feedback to learn the behavior or pattern. These algorithms are specific to a particular problem e.g. Google Self Driving car, AlphaGo where a bot competes with human and even itself to getting better and better performer of Go Game. Each time we feed in data, they learn and add the data to its knowledge that is training data. So, more it learns the better it get trained and hence experienced.
